# Jelly_Fish_Tank 🐟🐠🐡🥽

This is my first go at generative art using processing. The project is inspired by MARCIN IGNAC's post about his 'Cindermedusae' project: http://marcinignac.com/blog/cindermedusae-making-generative-creatures/

The code randomly generates new instances of jelly fish which have a randomly defined set of characteristics (between realistic limits). Once these instances move off the screen they are deleted and a new instance is created below the screen, allowing the animation to indefinetly go on without repeating itself.
